			Rajput was born in Patna[2] to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh.[20] His ancestral home is in Bihar's Purnea district.[21][22] One of his sisters, Mitu Singh, is a state-level cricketer.[2][23] His mother's death in 2002[24] left Rajput devastated and it was in the same year that the family moved from Patna to Delhi.[2]

			Rajput attended St. Karen's High School in Patna and Kulachi Hansraj Model School in New Delhi.[25] According to Rajput, he had ranked seventh in the DCE Entrance Exam in 2003,[26] and secured admission in the Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical Engineering) class in Delhi College of Engineering.[2] He was also a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.[27] In all, he cleared as many as 11 engineering entrance exams, including that for the Indian School of Mines.[2] After he started participating in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies, resulting in several backlogs which ultimately made him leave DCE.[26] He completed only three years of the four-year course before dropping out to pursue an acting career.

		n 2008, the casting team of Balaji Telefilms saw Rajput's personality and acting talent while he was on stage for one of Ekjute's plays.[30] They invited him to audition for them and Rajput landed the role of Preet Juneja in Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil.[31] His character was killed quite early in the show, but he was such a popular character with the viewers that he was brought back for the series finale in the form of a spirit, looking on as his family celebrates after going through difficult times.[32]

		In June 2009, Rajput began starring in Pavitra Rishta as Manav Deshmukh, a serious and mature character working as a mechanic to support his family. His work in this serial received wide appreciation, and Rajput received three major television awards for best male actor and most popular actor.[30] This performance was his breakthrough and gave him a stepping stone into films.[33] Initially when producer Ekta Kapoor cast him as lead for Pavitra Rishta while playing the parallel lead in Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, Zee TV did not accept him. However, Kapoor convinced them to accept him.[34]

		In May 2010, Rajput joined the dance reality show Zara Nachke Dikha 2.[35] He had already proven his acting talents by winning awards for his performance in Pavitra Rishta, and he wanted to establish that he had good dancing skills and could be trained further. In Zara Nachke Dikha, Rajput was a part of the Mast Kalandar Boys Team. He did the shooting for both Pavitra Rishta and Zara Nachke Dikha 2 at the same time.[35] On the Mother's Day special episode, his team dedicated a performance to his mother, who had died in 2002.[36]

		In December 2010, Rajput participated in another dance-based reality show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 4, where he was paired with choreographer Shampa Sonthalia.[37]

		In October 2011, Rajput decided to quit Pavitra Rishta to pursue a film-making course abroad and in November 2011 Rajput quit the series and was replaced by Hiten Tejwani.[38] However, in October 2014, Tejwani paved way for Rajput who appeared in the final episode aired on 25 October 2014 as Manav.
